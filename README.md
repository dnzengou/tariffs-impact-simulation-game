# tariffs-impact-simulation-game
Let’s transform the "Liberation Day" tariff simulation into a dynamic, interactive web app for online deployment where we’ll use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js to create a user-friendly interface users can adjust parameters, run simulations, and explore results through visualizations.

The app will be lightweight, deployable on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, and accessible via any modern browser.
